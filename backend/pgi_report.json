In contrast, two ER negative cell lines lacking detectable Rb were fully resistant to palbociclib. Knockdown of Rb in 3 of the tested Rb positive cell lines led to moderate palbociclib resistance in short term incubation experiments.  In longer term (15 day) palbociclib incubations of ER negative MDA-MB-231 cells and ER positive MCF-7 cells, significant resistance to palbociclib was seen in Rb knockdown conditions while wild-type Rb cells maintained sensitivity."

NR6 mouse fibroblast cells transduced to co-express ERBB2 L869R and T798I responded to afatinib treatment with reduced ERBB2 phosphorylation, similar to ERBB2 wt cells. MCF10A cells transduced with ERBB2 T798I alone or ERBB2 L869R and T798I co-expressed responded to afatinib with reductions in phosphorylated ERBB2, AKT, ERK and S6 at levels similar to ERBB2 wt expressing cells.

The patient initially responded to neratinib. After 5 months on neratinib, the patient progressed. Addition of fulvestrant induced prompt response. The patient progressed 10 months following fulvestrant initiation. ERBB2 T798I was found in a post-progression biopsy, but not in pre-progression biopsies. In vitro, HEK293 cells transfected with ERBB2 T798I or ERBB2 T798I and L869R (in cis) did not demonstrate reduced phosphorylation in ERBB2, AKT and ERK when treated with neratinib at concentrations of 180nM; however cells expressing ERBB2 L869R and ERBB2 wt, demonstrated reduced phosphorylation at 20nM. MCF10A cells transfected with ERBB2 L869R and T798I were resistant to neratinib compared to cells expressing ERBB2 L869R alone (IC50s: 154nM vs 23.9nM). Functional experiments revealed that ERBB2 T798I has limited transforming capabilities and is not likely an oncogenic driver.

The patient initially responded to neratinib. After 5 months on neratinib, the patient progressed. Addition of fulvestrant induced prompt response. The patient progressed 10 months following fulvestrant initiation. ERBB2 T798I was found in a post-progression biopsy, but not in pre-progression biopsies. In vitro, HEK293 cells transfected with ERBB2 T798I or ERBB2 T798I and L869R (in cis) did not demonstrate reduced phosphorylation in ERBB2, AKT and ERK when treated with neratinib at concentrations of 180nM; however cells expressing ERBB2 L869R and ERBB2 wt, demonstrated reduced phosphorylation at 20nM. MCF10A cells transfected with ERBB2 L869R and T798I were resistant to neratinib compared to cells expressing ERBB2 L869R alone (IC50s: 154nM vs 23.9nM). Functional experiments revealed that ERBB2 T798I has limited transforming capabilities and is not likely an oncogenic driver. Authors concluded that ERBB2 T798I is likely a secondary resistance mutation to neratinib."

Paired samples containing tumor were obtained for 98% (118 of 121). Ki67 fell significantly with lapatinib,, but not with placebo (-3%). Whereas Ki67 reduction with lapatinib was greatest in HER2(+) breast cancer, there was a significant Ki67 decrease in HER2(-) breast cancer (-27%) with 14% of HER2(-), demonstrating ≥50% Ki67 reduction with lapatinib. Among HER2(-) tumors, only HER3 mRNA levels were significantly associated with Ki67 response on multivariate analysis. In HER2(-) breast cancer, HER2 and HER3 mRNA levels were highly correlated, with all Ki67 responders having elevated HER3 and HER2 expression. Lapatinib has antiproliferative effects in a subgroup of HER2(-) nonamplified tumors characterized by high HER3 expression. The possible role of high HER2:HER3 heterodimers in predicting response to lapatinib merits investigation in HER2(-) tumors."

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. The authors tested several basal and luminal cell lines harboring PTEN loss for sensitivity to GDC-0941. ZR-75-1, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.15uM and reduction in phosphorylated AKT was noted following administration of GDC-0941. EVSTA-T, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.36uM; treatment resulted in an relative increase of Sub-G and G phase cells from 49% to 78% of total cells evaluated; there was a 12fold increase in annexin V (an apoptotic marker), and a substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT following GDC-0941 administration. Seven basal-like cell lines harbored PTEN loss and had IC50s ranging fom 0.30uM to 20.00uM (4/7 had IC50s greater than 1 uM). There was a varied reduction in phosphorylated AKT among basal-like cell lines. Authors note that PTEN status may have low predictive power for response, and suggested that other factors such as basal/luminal characteristics may be more informative for GDC-0941 response. Authors further note that luminal type cell lines are generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal type cell lines (p=0.02)."

The authors tested several basal and luminal cell lines harboring PTEN loss for sensitivity to GDC-0941. ZR-75-1, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.15uM and reduction in phosphorylated AKT was noted following administration of GDC-0941. EVSTA-T, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.36uM; treatment resulted in an relative increase of Sub-G and G phase cells from 49% to 78% of total cells evaluated; there was a 12fold increase in annexin V (an apoptotic marker), and a substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT following GDC-0941 administration. Seven basal-like cell lines harbored PTEN loss and had IC50s ranging fom 0.30uM to 20.00uM (4/7 had IC50s greater than 1 uM). There was a varied reduction in phosphorylated AKT among basal-like cell lines. Authors note that PTEN status may have low predictive power for response, and suggested that other factors such as basal/luminal characteristics may be more informative for GDC-0941 response. Authors further note that luminal type cell lines are generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal type cell lines (p=0.02)."
